# Day 4

On the fourth day we'll learn how to take SQL beyond simple CRUD operations and perform more complex queries. We will use this power of SQL to implement our "Trending Posts" list - returning only recent posts with a large number of upvotes. We will use `JOIN`s to address a data normalization issue we have.

Congratulations! By the end of the day we'll finish implementing our backend services by handling upvotes, displaying usernames in the posting list, and showing only highly-rated posts on the "Trending Posts" page.

## Part 1: The Upvote Button

**Talking Points:**
- How do we store this? [Normalization?]
- How do we retrieve this (lists and single)? [In one statement?]

**Application Changes:**
- Update upvote button endpoint & Javascript (post id)
- Update database schema
